# Casumer Corona Tracker

This PWA shows incidence- and case-numbers for germany and certain districts. The user is able to change the displayed districts to fit their needs.

## For Developers

If you'd like to deploy your own version, just clone the repo, install svelte globally, hit 'npm install' and you can build the app. For the deploy script (ftp upload) just put a 'FTP_PASSWORD = [your password]' in the .env file and adjust the configuration in the deploy.js

## Corona API
We use Marlon360's rki-covid-api: [https://github.com/marlon360/rki-covid-api]

Thank you very much for your work!
